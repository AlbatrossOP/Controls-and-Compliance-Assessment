<h1>Controls and Compliance Assessment</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project utilized security parameters of a fake compamy known as Botium toys. I reviewed said security parameters, and produced an assessment of their security posture. This assessment covered all assets, as well as internal processes and precedures. This review exposed failiures to adhere to best practices, and provided suggestions to improve compliance and better prepare the organization for a potential threat or attack.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
Multiple controls need to be implemented to improve Botium Toysâ€™ security posture and better ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, including: Least Privilege, disaster recovery plans, password policies, separation of duties, an IDS, legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system. The company also needs to properly classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
